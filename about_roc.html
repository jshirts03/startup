            <h1>About the ROC</h1>
            <p id="description">The ROC (short for "roar of the cougars") is the nickname for the student section at BYU.
                Known for being loud and 100% sober, it is known to cause opposing teams to quake in their boots.
                At least 5 false starts and 20 missed free throws have been caused by this awesome fanbase. 
                Due to the popularity of BYU sports, the ROC consistently hits max capacity, leaving students to watch the games at home with no connection to their fellow fans.
                The virtual ROC does not aim to replicate the in-person ROC experience(it is impossible), but it does try to connect those loyal, strong, and true BYU fans to share in the victories and (very rare) defeats of the cougars.
