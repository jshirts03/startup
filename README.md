# Virtual ROC

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. Hi! This is my first time using github. Does this work?
Yes!! This works. I have now made another change, but I'm going to try and do this from the terminal. Yay! I am now a pro at editing things in VS code and Github.


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

I come from a family of die-hard BYU fans. We love watching the BYU football, soccer, volleyball, and basketball games, but we can never watch the games together because we're all scattered across the country! Go Cougs allows a group of friends or family to react to the game in real time in a BYU themed group chat where you can share the joys of victory with those you love!

### Design

![Design image](images/sketch1.jpg)

The interface should display plenty of BYU school spirit, with some custom emoji's and/or GIF's that are BYU specific.


### Key features

- Login with username and password
- Clean aesthetics, themed in Royal blue and White
- Custom reactions such as Touchdown, Field Goal, First down, DEFENSE, 3rd down roar, Cosmo dance, Y hand, Sitake dance, etc.
- Display of motivational quotes
- Real time chat updates

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure. Probably 2 HTML pages, 1 for login, and 1 for chatting
- **CSS** - Application adjustable for all screen sizes. BYU theme makes you want to rise and shout.
- **React** - Provides login, displays chat messages, allows user input for chat and/or reactions
- **Service** - Backend services for login and logout, will use the Inspiration API to give random motivational quotes
- **DB/Login** - Register and login users. Remember chat history
- **WebSocket** - Chat messages and reactions updated real time on all connected users
